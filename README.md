## Features
The application includes the following functionalities:
1. **User Registration:** Add new users with a username and password.
2. **Profile Management:** Change an existing user's password.
3. **Post Management:** Add or remove posts from a user's profile.
4. **Friend Management:** Add or remove friends from a user's profile.
5. **Post Display:** View posts from a specific user.
6. **Exit:** Quit the application.

## Project Overview
This project simulates the backend operations of a simplified social media platform:
- **User Management:** Users are stored as a sorted linked list.
- **Friend Management:** Each user's friends are maintained as a sorted linked list.
- **Post Management:** Posts are organized as a stack for each user.

### Key Concepts
- **Data Structures:** 
  - Linked lists for users and friends.
  - Stack implementation for posts.
- **Memory Management:** Efficiently manage dynamic memory for user profiles and their data.
- **Error Handling:** Input validation and appropriate feedback for invalid operations.

## Technical Requirements
- **Programming Language:** C (no C++ elements allowed).
- **Compiler:** GCC or equivalent C compiler.
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code (recommended).
- **Constraints:**
  - No global variables.
  - Use only the concepts covered in the specified lectures (1â€“20).
